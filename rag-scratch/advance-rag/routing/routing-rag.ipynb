Text/Code Editor vs. Word Processor    Recommended Code Editors    Essential VS Code Extensions for HTML    Emmet for HTML Productivity           Introduction to HTML      HTML is the foundation of all websites. \\nIn this guide, you’ll understand the essentials of HTML and get started with web development.\\nWhat is HTML?\\nHTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It’s the standard markup language for creating and structuring web pages. HTML defines the structure and content of your web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.\\nWhat is HTML5?\\nHTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It introduces new tags, attributes, and features, making it simpler and more efficient to build modern, interactive web pages. HTML5 is also designed to be fully backward compatible with previous HTML versions.\\nHow much HTML should you learn?\\nYou only need the basics of HTML to start creating websites. Typically, mastering HTML essentials should not take more than a weekend. Understand the core tags and structure, and you’re all set to build web pages effectively.\\nText/Code Editor vs. Word Processor\\n\\n\\nText editors are specialized tools for writing and editing plain text files, including source code. They include essential features for coding such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and code formatting.\\n\\n\\nWord processors like Microsoft Word or Google Docs are ideal for creating formatted documents such as letters, reports, or presentations—but they’re not suitable for coding.\\n\\n\\nFor HTML development, always use a code editor.\\nRecommended Code Editors\\nHere are some recommended code editors for writing HTML efficiently:\\n\\nVisual Studio Code – Powerful, widely-used, and beginner-friendly.\\nZed – Fast and collaborative editor for modern development.\\nVIM – Highly customizable and efficient (but notoriously tricky to exit!).\\nHelix – Similar to VIM, but easier to use right out of the box.\\n\\nEssential VS Code Extensions for HTML\\nEnhance your HTML coding experience with these recommended VS Code extensions:\\n\\nHTML Snippets – Quickly insert common HTML structures.\\nLive Server – Automatically refreshes your browser as you edit your HTML.\\n\\nEmmet for HTML Productivity\\nEmmet is built-in with VS Code and allows you to rapidly generate HTML code using short abbreviations. This significantly speeds up your coding workflow. No need to manually type lengthy tags—let Emmet handle it for you.\\nSpend some time getting familiar with Emmet shortcuts to greatly improve your productivity.

You can move to any time in the game and you can always go back to the previous checkpoint. This is the same concept in software development.\\nBefore Git became mainstream, version control systems were used by developers to manage their code. They were called SCCS (Source Code Control System). SCCS was a proprietary software that was used to manage the history of code. It was expensive and not very user-friendly. Git was created to replace SCCS and to make version control more accessible and user-friendly. Some commong version control systems are Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.\\nLearning Path'),\n",

In his Ph.D. thesis, Stroustrup tried Simula to inject Object Oriented Programming (OOP) into the language. However, he found that the language was too complex and difficult to use, so he decided to develop his own language.\\nThe first version of C++ was released in 1989, and it was called “C with Classes”. It was a significant departure from C, as it introduced classes and objects, which allowed for more modular and reusable code. C++ quickly gained popularity and became the de facto standard for C programming.\\nOver the years, C++ has evolved and gained new features and improvements.

An app is a self-contained module that contains models, views, templates, and other components of your project. Apps allow you to organize your code into logical units and make it easier to manage and maintain your project.\\nYou can create it manually or use the startapp command to create a new app for you. To create an app, navigate to the directory where you want to create the app and run the following command:\\nTerminal windowpython manage.py startapp chai\\nThis will create a new directory called chai with the necessary files and directories for an app.\\nTo add an app to your project, you need to add it to the INSTALLED_APPS setting in your project’s settings.py file. You can do this by adding the app’s name to the list of installed apps:'),\n",

Each app can have its own templates directory, which contains the templates for that app. Create a new directory called templates in your app’s directory. Inside the chai directory, create a templates directory and add a all_chai.html file to it.\\nAdd your basic html code to the all_chai.html file.\\nTo serve this file, we need a view and a url.

Create a new file called base.html in your project’s templates directory. Add the following code to the file:\\nbase.html{% load static %}\\n<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head>  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{% static \\'style.css\\' %}\">\\n  <title>    {% block title %}      Chai aur Django    {% endblock title %}  </title></head><body>  <nav>I will add it later</nav>  {% block content %}  {% endblock %}</body></html>'),\n",

To use it, you need to include it in your templates. For example, if you want to use the layout for the all_chai view, you can add the following code to the all_chai.html file:\\nall_chai.html{% extends \"base.html\" %}\\n{% block title %}  All Chai{% endblock %}\\n{% block content %}  <h1>All Chai</h1>  <p>This is the all chai page.</p>{% endblock %}\\nThis will use the base.html layout and override the title and content blocks with the appropriate values for the all_chai view.\\nSummary'),\n",

      "Assistant Response: chai-aur-git\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "page_content: Check your git version\n",
      "To check your git version, you can run the following command:\n",
      "Terminal windowgit --version\n",
      "This command will display the version of git installed on your system. Git is a very stable software and don’t get any breaking changes in majority of the cases, at least in my experience.\n",
      "Repository\n",
      "A repository is a collection of files and directories that are stored together. It is a way to store and manage your code. A repository is like a folder on your computer, but it is more than just a folder. It can contain other files, folders, and even other repositories. You can think of a repository as a container that holds all your code.\n",
      "There is a difference between a software on your system vs tracking a particular folder on your system. At any point you can run the following command to see the current state of your repository:\n",
      "Terminal windowgit status, source: https://chaidocs.vercel.app/youtube/chai-aur-git/terminology/\n",
      "page_content: Git diff\n",
      "The git diff is an informative command that shows the differences between two commits. It is used to compare the changes made in one commit with the changes made in another commit. Git consider the changed versions of same file as two different files. Then it gives names to these two files and shows the differences between them.\n",
      "How to Read the Diff Output, source: https://chaidocs.vercel.app/youtube/chai-aur-git/diff-stash-tags/\n",
      "page_content: Terminal windowgit config --global user.email \"your-email@example.com\"git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
      "Now you can check your config settings:\n",
      "Terminal windowgit config --list\n",
      "This will show you all the settings that you have changed.\n",
      "Creating a repository\n",
      "Creating a repository is a process of creating a new folder on your system and initializing it as a git repository. It’s just regular folder to code your project, you are just asking git to track it. To create a repository, you can use the following command:\n",
      "Terminal windowgit statusgit init\n",
      "git status command will show you the current state of your repository. git init command will create a new folder on your system and initialize it as a git repository. This adds a hidden .git folder to your project.\n",
      "Commit, source: https://chaidocs.vercel.app/youtube/chai-aur-git/terminology/\n",
      "page_content: Commit\n",
      "Terminal windowgit commit -m \"commit message\"git status\n",
      "Here we are committing the changes to the repository. We can see that the changes are now committed to the repository. The -m flag is used to add a message to the commit. This message is a short description of the changes that were made. You can use this message to remember what the changes were.\n",
